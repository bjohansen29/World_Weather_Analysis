## Project Summary

At customer request, using Pandas, Python, and Google Maps APIs, a travel itinerary was created. 
After choosing a desired temperature range for the customer's preferences, a list of cities is developed, followed by a list of hotels within this city.

Once cities are chosen, an itinerary is developed and a map of the destination cities is displayed.
